"""Stitch v3 -- OFFSET stitching vias with a stub, for pads with no room at centre.

WHY v3 EXISTS (measured 2026-10-14)
-----------------------------------
v2 asked "does a 0.60 mm via fit AT THE PAD CENTRE?" and correctly REJECTED 63 pads
where it does not. That was the right safety call, but it left 4 pads unconnected --
pads on C_MON, J_W1, J_W3 and C_HF that the router had already given a short GND
stub track, and which the v2 check would not stitch.

The correct fix is not to shrink the via (a sub-0.60 mm via would violate the frozen
rule set) and not to accept the open. It is to put the SAME 0.60 mm via SOMEWHERE
THAT FITS and join it to the pad with a short GND track. A GND stub plus an offset
via is a normal, manufacturable plane tap.

WHAT v3 DOES
  For every GND pad not already stitched:
    1. search outward on a 0.25 mm ring (r = 0.6 .. 4.0 mm) around the pad centre for
       a via position that clears every FOREIGN net by (via_d/2 + clearance)
    2. if found, drop the via there AND add a GND track from the pad to the via
    3. if no position on any ring qualifies, report the pad as UNRESOLVABLE rather
       than silently leaving it (so the remaining count is honest)

  It never moves a part, never deletes, and never shrinks the via. It is idempotent:
  a pad within 1.0 mm of an existing GND via is left alone.

    # WHY THIS PREDICATE WAS WRONG (measured 2026-10-15)
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The original `free()` tested the candidate via centre against the AXIS-ALIGNED BOUNDING BOX of
    # every foreign item, with an inside-corner distance test. Two independent defects followed:
    #
    #   1. A bbox is not a shape. A diagonal track's bounding box is a large rectangle, so a point can
    #      clear the box corner and still sit ON the track; conversely a legitimately empty spot next
    #      to a diagonal can be rejected. Vias therefore ended up colliding with COPPER.
    #   2. Hole-to-hole spacing was NEVER tested. That is a DRILL rule, and this predicate only ever
    #      used the COPPER diameter, so two drills could be arbitrarily close.
    #
    # Measured consequence of enabling offset mode with the old predicate: errors 29 -> 56, including
    # `shorting_items` 5 (REAL SHORTS), `hole_to_hole` 34, `tracks_crossing` 2, `holes_co_located` 2.
    # It reduced "unresolvable pads" 55 -> 12 -- the metric it optimises -- while breaking the board.
    #
    # The fix uses KiCad's own geometry: every foreign item is turned into a real polygon (arcs
    # approximated), so the test is shape-accurate, and hole spacing is checked separately against the
    # same minimum the frozen ruleset enforces.
    HOLE_TO_HOLE = 0.25          # jlcpcb-s1-frozen.kicad_dru: hole-to-hole minimum

        KiCad 9 -- "UNDEFINED_LAYER is no longer allowed". Passing it made _polys() throw for every
        pad, so pads were silently dropped from the copper test and "UNRESOLVABLE" fell to 0 while 71
        vias were placed. A predicate that silently tests NOTHING is worse than one that is too loose,
