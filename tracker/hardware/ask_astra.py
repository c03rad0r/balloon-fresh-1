"""Ask the gpt-6-astra visual consultant ANY question about ANY image(s).

WHY THIS EXISTS. test_astra_vision.py hardcodes a prompt about F.Cu routing plots. When it was pointed
at a connector cross-section, Astra correctly refused to answer the routing question -- so the call
produced a verdict about the wrong thing and looked like an answer. A hardcoded prompt is a question
you cannot change, and therefore a question you will ask wrongly.

This tool takes the prompt and the images as arguments, so the question always matches the artefact.

Usage:
    ask_astra.py "your question" image.png [image2.png ...]
    ask_astra.py --prompt-file q.txt image.png
    ask_astra.py --review   image.png      # runs the standing visual-review rubric

Always prints the SERVED model id, because the request alias and the served model can differ (the live
router serves gpt-6-astra for several aliases, and has silently served other families for others).

REVIEW_PROMPT = """You are reviewing a diagram, drawing or plot before it is shown to the operator or to a
fabricator. Your job is to find what is WRONG, not to confirm what is right.

Answer each literally. If a check passes, say so in one clause. If it fails, name the exact location
and the defect.

1. OVERLAP: is any text overlapping other text, or overlapping a drawn element?
2. CLIPPING: is any text or graphic cut off by the image boundary, or running under another block?
3. LEGIBILITY: is every label readable at the size shown? Name any that are not.
4. CONSISTENCY: do dimensions, labels and callouts agree with each other? Any contradiction is a defect.
5. COMPLETENESS: is anything named in the text but NOT drawn (or vice versa)? Say which.
6. ARROW / DIMENSION CONVENTION: are arrows and dimension lines drawn the standard way (extension lines,
   opposed arrowheads, arrows pointing AT the extension lines)? Name any that read wrongly.
7. TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS: does the drawing show what it claims to show? Would a fabricator or engineer
   be misled by anything?
8. TYPOS: quote any misspelled word or wrong unit verbatim.

Then: list every defect as a numbered, actionable item a person could fix without further explanation.

Finish with EXACTLY one line:
VERDICT: CLEAN
or
VERDICT: DEFECTS_PRESENT <count>
or
VERDICT: WRONG_QUESTION <one line saying what the image actually is, if it is not what the prompt assumed>
