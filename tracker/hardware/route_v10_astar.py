"""v10 grid A* router with via support -- THE ONLY PERMITTED ROUTING METHOD (ADR-126).

Why this replaced the straight/L router (operator directive 2026-10-21):
the L-path router produced a lane at 0.000 mm over U_C.9, two dead-end stubs, and 21.7 mm
of copper through the F33's body. The operator chose "a real grid/A* router with via
support -- and make sure this approach is taken in all future attempts".

DESIGN
  * grid: 0.1 mm pitch over the board outline
  * two layers: F.Cu (0) and B.Cu (1); a via (0.50 / 0.25 mm, the measured legal minimum)
    costs VIA_COST, so vias are used only when they save real distance
  * obstacles come from the CONNECTIVITY REGISTRY, not from hand-typed tables:
      - every pad of another net -> blocked + CLEAR margin (unnamed pads INCLUDED: they
        are metal -- this is bug B5, which is how U_C.9 was hit)
      - every NPTH hole (tether/wing) -> blocked + 0.5 mm (ADR-125)
      - component bodies -> blocked on their own side (ADR: no copper under modules)
      - board edge -> blocked within EDGE_KEEP
  * cost = distance + VIA_COST per via + small bend penalty; A* with a Manhattan heuristic
  * the path is validated by the SAME predicates the gates use before a single track is
    written: a route that would fail check_lane_clearance / check_lane_integrity /
    check_copper_under_body / check_hole_clearance is rejected, never saved.
